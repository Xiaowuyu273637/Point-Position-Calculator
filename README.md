## 个人吐槽
我现在有点想不明白我为什么要开发出来，这带给我什么好处了？就算没有好处，那就没好处吧。开发原因：只因调不好才做的，结果遇到新开发的产品，没有程序才做的。为什么开发：只因听别人吹牛逼说有人会算五孔位置，结果我找到被吹牛逼那个人，结果他说他不会，那我能怎么办？结果有一次改机种发现兵哥会算，但是他看起来会打我的样子，所以一般我都不会找他帮忙，对他有一种莫名的害怕。结果遇到新开发做样式的339810，没有办法，我下班洗完澡打开电脑使用deepseek AI赶紧做出来第一版把位置算出来，并且使用AutoCAD画图软件验证，后来发现，第一版位置是相反了，第二点的直径怎么可能比第一点大呢，原来是公式错了：60-64=4+60=64，把点位倒过来写了，正确做法是移除掉这个。0.02版本点位偏差超过0.1，修改起点到点的半径*2再四舍五入等于直径再除2等于半径，算了太废话了，反正也不会有人用，也不会也有人看到，其实我想说，这逼厂制造长的技术都不如我，叫技术过来跟样品，技术看着我弄，没改好就在群里哔哔，一点小问题都不会解决，懒得要死，我TM都不想干了，手又过敏，又脱皮又好不了，要不是我下一年去参军我TM才懒得留在这，我连上几个月不休息都没满勤，想要个满勤都没有，还TM制造长转班我们没休息，我干你妈，搭档又懒又没技术，拆个工装都要半个小时，我跟他说我想把五孔程序都改成用同一刀补，他说随便我，这个死蠢改程序X轴很难吗，一个程序一个新刀补，看着就冒火，我不想管他。原本想等他下台后把程序都换成标准X轴，人呢？那个经理又说要来新人，等几个月了，毛都没看到，所以他说这句话的时候我就是在看傻子，根本不可信的。经理看到这个计算器的时候就问我这是什么，我说这是为了做样品开发的计算器，结果他还让我搞环形槽的，双油槽的，除了双油槽最简单了，环形槽就懒得弄了，没做出来，TMD工资不涨就算了，还让我做其他的计算器，想做自己做去，就像老付说的，屁事又多，工资又不涨。压榨员工、把压力全部给员工（这是我说的），还有下班后临时改机种每次都这样，我8点前没洗澡，偏偏9点给我发消息，TM有病是不是，我刚洗完就打电话过来，我TM在洗衣服，就TM这样，有没有加班费？就算没有加班费，我也不在意，钱这个东西，没有就没有，钱又不是万能的，我现在何必要在意？

##续
最近我有点想明白了，或许我这种无非就是工匠精神吧，我也不敢肯定，因为我才入职多久？从实习到正式员工我才用了多久？这种随随便便靠AI制作的计算工具，随便超别人十年，甚至几十年工作经验才能算，我只是一个普通人，做这个完全跟我的兴趣有关，这样挺好的，但也挺累的，我甚至都不想去弄了，但是我还有家庭，我有我妈妈和我爸爸，还有一个我最爱的人，我不能倒下。

## Personal Thoughts  
I’m a bit confused now about why I even developed this. What benefit did it bring me? Even if there’s no benefit, then so be it. The reason for development: I made it simply because I couldn’t adjust it properly, and then I encountered a newly developed product without a program, so I had to create one. Why did I develop it? Because I heard someone bragging that there was a person who could calculate five-hole positions, but when I found the person they were talking about, he said he couldn’t do it. What was I supposed to do? Then, one time when modifying a machine model, I discovered Brother Bing could calculate it, but he seemed like he might hit me, so I generally avoided asking him for help. I felt inexplicably afraid of him. Eventually, when working on the newly developed model 339810, I had no choice. After getting off work and taking a shower, I opened my computer and quickly used DeepSeek AI to create the first version to calculate the positions, then verified it using AutoCAD. Later, I realized the first version had reversed positions. How could the diameter of the second point be larger than the first? It turned out the formula was wrong: 60-64=4+60=64. I had written the points backward. The correct approach was to remove this. Version 0.02 had point deviations exceeding 0.1. I fixed it by calculating the radius from the starting point to the point, multiplying by 2, rounding to get the diameter, and then dividing by 2 to get the radius. But I’m rambling too much. Anyway, no one will likely use this, and no one will even see it.  

Actually, I want to say that the manufacturing department’s technical skills in this factory aren’t as good as mine. When the technical staff came to follow up on samples, they just watched me work. If something wasn’t fixed, they’d complain in the group chat, unable to solve even minor issues. They’re lazy as hell, and I don’t even want to work here anymore. My hands are allergic, peeling, and not healing. If I weren’t planning to join the military next year, I wouldn’t bother staying. I’ve worked for months without a break and still didn’t get full attendance. The manufacturing department changed shifts without giving us breaks—I’m so pissed. My partner is lazy and lacks skills. It takes him half an hour to disassemble a fixture. When I told him I wanted to change all five-hole programs to use the same tool compensation, he said, “Do whatever.” This idiot finds it hard to modify the X-axis in a program? Every program has a new tool compensation, and it’s infuriating to see. I don’t want to deal with him anymore. I originally planned to replace all programs with standard X-axis settings after he left, but where is he? The manager said new hires were coming, but it’s been months and there’s no sign of anyone. So, when he said that, I just thought he was a fool. You can’t trust him.  

When the manager saw this calculator, he asked me what it was. I told him it was for sample development, and then he asked me to create ones for ring grooves and double oil grooves. Aside from the double oil groove being the simplest, I didn’t bother with the ring groove one. It never got done. Not only is my salary not increasing, but they also want me to make other calculators. If they want them, they should make them themselves. Like Old Fu said, there’s too much nonsense work, and the pay isn’t increasing. They’re squeezing employees and dumping all the pressure on us (that’s what I say). And there’s always last-minute machine model changes after work. Every time, I haven’t showered by 8 p.m., and they message me at 9 p.m. Are they insane? They call me right after I finish showering while I’m washing clothes. Is there overtime pay? Even if there isn’t, I don’t care. Money isn’t everything, and there’s no need for me to worry about it now.  

## Continued  
Lately, I’ve started to understand. Perhaps what I’m doing is nothing more than the spirit of craftsmanship. I can’t say for sure, though, because how long have I been in this job? From intern to full-time employee, how much time did it take? This casually AI-made calculation tool easily surpasses decades, even centuries, of work experience. I’m just an ordinary person, and creating this is entirely related to my interests. It’s good, but it’s also exhausting. I don’t even want to do it anymore, but I have my family—my mom and dad, and the person I love most. I can’t give up.
